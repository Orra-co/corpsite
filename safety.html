        <h1>Dating Safety Advice</h1>

        <p>While meeting new people can be thrilling, it&#39;s essential to exercise caution when engaging with
unfamiliar individuals. Prioritize your safety by using sound judgment, whether you&#39;re
exchanging initial messages or planning to meet face-to-face. Although you can&#39;t control the
actions of others, there are proactive steps you can take to enhance your safety during your
Orra experience.</p>

        <h1>Online Safety</h1>
        <p>1. Avoid Sending Money or Sharing Financial Details: Refrain from sending money, particularly
via wire transfer, even if the individual cites an emergency. Sending funds via wire transfer is
akin to handing over cash – reversing the transaction or tracing its path is exceedingly difficult.
Additionally, never disclose information that could grant access to your financial accounts.
Should another user request money from you, promptly report the incident to us. For guidance
on sidestepping romance scams, consult advice from the U.S Federal Trade Commission
available on the FTC website.<br><br>
2. Safeguard Your Personal Data: Refrain from divulging personal information like your social
security number, home or work address, or specifics regarding your daily schedule (e.g.,
frequenting a particular gym every Monday) to individuals you haven&#39;t established trust with. If
you&#39;re a parent, exercise caution in sharing information about your children on your profile or
during initial conversations. Avoid disclosing details such as your children&#39;s names, school
locations, or ages and genders.<br><br>
3. Remain Within Orra&#39;s Environment: Maintain your interactions exclusively within the Orra
platform as you acquaint yourself with someone. Given that communications on Orra may be
monitored by our Message Filters, individuals with malicious intentions frequently attempt to
shift conversations to text, messaging apps, email, or phone immediately.<br><br>
4. Exercise Caution with Long-Distance and International Connections: Exercise caution with
individuals who assert to be from your country but are purportedly stranded elsewhere,
particularly if they solicit financial aid to return home. Approach with caution anyone who refuses
to meet in person or engage in a phone/video call—they may not be genuine. If someone
evades your inquiries or rushes into a committed relationship without prior face-to-face
interaction or adequate acquaintance with you, consider it a warning sign.<br><br></p>

        <p>5. Report Any Suspicious or Offensive Conduct: If you perceive that someone has transgressed
acceptable boundaries, please notify us. Block and report individuals who contravene our
guidelines. Here are several instances of violations to be aware of:</p><br>

<li>Requests for money or donations</li><br>
<li>Underage users</li><br>
<li>Harassment, threats, and offensive messages</li><br>
<li>Inappropriate or harmful behavior during or after meeting in person</li><br>
<li>Fraudulent profiles</li><br>
<li>Fraudulent profiles</li><br>
<li>Spam or solicitation including links to commercial websites or attempts to sell products
    or services</li><br>


<p>Feel free to report any apprehensions regarding suspicious conduct from any profile page or
messaging window. For additional details, refer to our Community Guidelines.</p>

       <h1>Meeting in Person</h1>

        <p></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Take your time to get to know the other person before agreeing to meet offline. Use
                    phone or video calls as screening tools.</li><br>
                <li>Choose populated, public places for initial meetings. Avoid private locations like homes.
                </li><br>
                <li>Choose populated, public places for initial meetings. Avoid private locations like homes.
                </li><br>
                <li>Inform friends or family members of your plans, including your location and schedule.
                </li><br>
                <li>Ensure you have control over your transportation, whether by driving yourself or
                </li><br>
                <li>arranging a backup plan like a ride-share service.
                </li><br>
                <li>Understand your limits regarding alcohol and drugs. Refuse any pressure to consume
                    beyond your comfort level.
                </li><br>
                <li>Keep track of your drinks and personal belongings at all times. Accept drinks served
                directly from the bartender or server.
                </li><br>
                <li>Trust your instincts and leave if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Seek assistance from
                bartenders or servers if needed.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            
<h1>When traveling as part of the LGBTQ+ community:</h1><br>


    <li>Exercise caution: While we aim for inclusivity, it&#39;s crucial to recognize that no destination
        is entirely free from risk, and certain countries may have laws targeting LGBTQ+
        individuals.</li><br>
    <li>Research local laws: Before traveling to a new location, familiarize yourself with the legal
        protections available based on sexual orientation. If you feel unsafe, consider disabling
        the &quot;Show me on Orra&quot; feature in your settings.</li><br>
    <li>Privacy protection: If you&#39;ve specified your sexual orientation on Orra, we&#39;ll conceal this
        information from your profile while you&#39;re in areas where it may pose a risk.</li><br>
    <li>Be cautious in certain countries: Some regions have a history of law enforcement using
        dating apps for entrapment. Additionally, recent legislation in some countries criminalizes
        communication on same-sex dating platforms, potentially escalating penalties for such
        interactions.</li><br>
    <li>Stay informed: Stay updated on the latest sexual orientation laws worldwide by visiting
    ILGA World. Consider supporting their research efforts through donations.</li><br>
            </p>

        <p>

    <h1>When it comes to sexual health and consent:</h1><br>

    <li>Safeguard yourself: Condoms, when used correctly and consistently, are effective in
        reducing the risk of contracting and transmitting STIs like HIV. However, be mindful of
        STIs such as herpes or HPV, which can spread through skin-to-skin contact. Some STIs&#39;
        risk can be lessened through vaccination.</li><br>
    <li>Know your status: Many STIs may not exhibit symptoms, underscoring the importance of
        regular testing to stay informed about your health status. Seek out nearby clinics for
        testing services (US only).</li><br>
    <li>Open communication: Discussing sexual health and STI testing with your partner is
        essential before engaging in physical intimacy. Keep in mind that knowingly transmitting
        an STI is considered a crime in certain jurisdictions. Need help initiating this
        conversation? Here are some useful tips.</li><br>
    <li>Consent is key: Consent is fundamental to any sexual activity and should involve
        ongoing communication and mutual agreement between partners. Verbal affirmation        
        helps ensure that boundaries are respected. Consent can be revoked at any time, and
        no one is entitled to sex. Refrain from proceeding if your partner appears hesitant,
        uncomfortable, or incapable of consenting due to substance influence. Learn more about
        consent from RAINN.</li><br>

    <h1>Resources for Help, Support, or Advice</h1>

    <p>It's important to remember that while these guidelines can help reduce risks, they are not foolproof.
