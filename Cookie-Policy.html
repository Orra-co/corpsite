            <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
            <p>
                At Orra, we value transparency and openness regarding how we collect and process data about
you. This page is designed to inform you about our practices concerning cookies and provide
guidance on managing them.<br>
Already familiar with cookies and looking to adjust your settings? No problem. Visit here to
update your website cookie settings, and adjust your privacy preferences in your app&#39;s account
settings.<br>
Interested in learning more about cookies and their usage? Please note that this Cookie Policy
specifically addresses our use of cookies and does not cover how we process your personal
information beyond this scope. To learn more about our broader approach to personal
information processing, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
            </p>

                <h1>What are cookies?</h1>

                    <p>
                        Cookies are small text files that are either sent to or accessed from your web browser or
device&#39;s memory. They typically contain the domain name (internet location) from which they
originated, their &quot;lifetime&quot; (expiry date), and a randomly generated unique identifier. Additionally,
cookies may store information about your device, such as user preferences, browsing history,
and activities conducted while using our services.
                    </p>

                <h1>Are there different types of cookies?</h1>

                <h3>First-party and third-party cookies:</h2>

                <p>

                    First-party cookies are directly placed on your device by us. For instance, we use them to adapt
                    our website to your browser&#39;s language preferences and gain insights into your website usage.
                    Third-party cookies, on the other hand, are placed by our partners and service providers. You
                    can learn more about these partners and service providers through our website and in-app
                    consent management tools.

                </p>

                <h3>
                    Session and persistent cookies:
                </h3>

                <p>

                    Session cookies expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies have a longer
lifespan, extending beyond the current browsing session. Persistent cookies may facilitate
quicker sign-in processes, serve analytical purposes, and more.
                </p>

                <h1>What about other tracking technologies?</h1>

                <p>
                    In addition to cookies, other technologies like web beacons, tracking URLs, or software
                    development kits (SDKs) are utilized for similar purposes. Web beacons are small graphics files
                    containing unique identifiers, tracking URLs help identify webpage traffic sources, and SDKs
                    function similarly to cookies and web beacons. For simplicity, we refer to these technologies as
                    &quot;cookies&quot; in this Cookie Policy.
                </p>

                <h3>What do we use cookies for?</h3>

                <p>Similar to other online service providers, we use cookies to deliver, secure, and enhance our
                    services. This includes remembering your preferences, recognizing you upon website visits,
                    
                    Cookie Policy
                    
                    assessing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and personalizing ads based on your
                    interests. To achieve these objectives, we may link cookie information with other personal data
                    we hold about you.</p>



                <h1>Cookie types:</h1>

                <p>

                    We utilize several types of cookies when you use our services, each serving specific purposes:

- Essential cookies: Essential for providing our services, facilitating logins, remembering
preferences, and detecting malicious activities.
<br><br>

                <h1>How can you control cookies?</h1>

                <p>

                    Various cookie management options are available to you, although altering your preferences
